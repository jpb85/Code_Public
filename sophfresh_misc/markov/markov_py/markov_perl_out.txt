CHORUS.
(In
which
the
cook
took
the
thimble,
looking
as
solemn
as
she
was
now
about
a
whiting
before.'
`I
can
hardly
breathe.'
`I
can't
help
it,'
she
said
aloud.
`I
shall
sit
here,'
the
Footman
continued
in
the
wood,'
continued
the
Gryphon.
`--you
advance
twice--'
`Each
with
a
shiver.
`I
beg
your
pardon!'
cried
Alice
again,
for
she
had
to
run
back
into
the
teapot.
`At
any
rate
I'll
never
go
THERE
again!'
said
Alice
more
boldly:
`you
know
you're
growing
too.'
`Yes,
but
some
crumbs
must
have
a
prize
herself,
you
know,'
the
Mock
Turtle
in
a
trembling
voice
to
a
mouse,
you
know.
But
do
cats
eat
bats?
Do
cats
eat
bats,
I
wonder?'
As
she
said
to
herself,
being
rather
proud
of
it:
`No
room!
No
room!'
they
cried
out
when
they
liked,
and
left
off
staring
at
the
time
he
was
going
to
begin
at
HIS
time
of
life.
The
King's
argument
was,
that
you
couldn't
cut
off
a
bit
of
the
expected
number
of
executions
the
Queen
never
left
off
writing
on
his
spectacles.
`Where
shall
I
begin,
please
your
Majesty!'
the
soldiers
had
to
fall
a
long
hookah,
and
taking
not
the
right
height
to
be.'
`It
is
wrong
from
beginning
to
see
the
earth
takes
twenty-four
hours
to
turn
into
a
butterfly,
I
should
think
it
so
VERY
much
out
of
sight.
Alice
remained
looking
thoughtfully
at
the
proposal.
`Then
the
Dormouse
crossed
the
court,
by
the
White
Rabbit,
trotting
slowly
back
again,
and
we
won't
talk
about
wasting
IT.
It's
HIM.'
`I
don't
know
what
a
long
and
a
long
way.
So
they
sat
down
with
wonder
at
the
mushroom
for
a
dunce?
Go
on!'
`I'm
a
poor
man,
your
Majesty,'
he
began.
`You're
a
very
difficult
question.
However,
at
last
she
stretched
her
arms
folded,
quietly
smoking
a
long
sleep
you've
had!'
`Oh,
I've
had
such
a
wretched
height
to
be.'
`It
is
a
raven
like
a
Jack-in-the-box,
and
up
the
fan
and
gloves.
`How
queer
it
seems,'
Alice
said
to
the
little
door,
so
she
bore
it
as
she
could
not
remember
ever
having
heard
of
such
a
thing
before,
and
he
called
the
Queen,
`and
take
this
child
away
with
me,'
thought
Alice,
`they're
sure
to
make
the
arches.
The
chief
difficulty
Alice
found
at
first
was
moderate.
But
the
snail
replied
"Too
far,
too
far!"
and
gave
a
sudden
burst
of
tears,
`I
do
wish
I
could
let
you
out,
you
know.'
It
was,
no
doubt:
only
Alice
did
not
dare
to
disobey,
though
she
knew
that
it
was
too
small,
but
at
last
turned
sulky,
and
would
only
say,
`I
am
older
than
I
am
now?
That'll
be
a
great
deal
of
thought,
and
rightly
too,
that
very
few
little
girls
in
my
kitchen
AT
ALL.
Soup
does
very
well
to
introduce
it.'
`I
don't
know
what
"it"
means
well
enough,
when
I
breathe"!'
`It
IS
the
use
of
repeating
all
that
green
stuff
be?'
said
Alice.
`You
did,'
said
the
Queen.
`I
never
saw
one,
or
heard
of
such
a
long
argument
with
the
tarts,
you
know--'
`What
did
they
draw?'
said
Alice,
a
little
of
the
ground,
Alice
soon
came
to
ME,
and
told
me
he
was
gone,
and
the
White
Rabbit,
who
was
sitting
on
the
top
of
her
sharp
little
chin.
`I've
a
right
to
think,'
said
Alice
to
herself,
rather
sharply;
`I
advise
you
to
leave
off
this
minute!'
She
generally
gave
herself
very
good
advice,
(though
she
very
soon
had
to
be
a
Caucus-race.'
`What
IS
the
same
thing
as
"I
get
what
I
could
say
if
I
know
who
I
am!
But
I'd
better
take
him
his
fan
and
two
or
three
of
the
house
if
it
please
your
Majesty?'
he
asked.
`Begin
at
the
sides
of
the
Nile
On
every
golden
scale!
`How
cheerfully
he
seems
to
be
seen:
she
found
she
had
quite
forgotten
the
Duchess
sneezed
occasionally;
and
as
the
hall
was
very
fond
of
beheading
people
here;
the
great
puzzle!'
And
she
kept
tossing
the
baby
was
howling
so
much
about
a
thousand
times
as
large
as
himself,
and
this
Alice
thought
to
herself.
At
this
moment
Alice
felt
dreadfully
puzzled.
The
Hatter's
remark
seemed
to
rise
like
a
telescope.'
And
so
it
was
out
of
it,
and
found
in
it
a
very
interesting
dance
to
watch,'
said
Alice,
very
earnestly.
`I've
had
nothing
else
to
do,
but
we
cannot
guarantee
to
stay
in
here
any
longer!'
She
waited
for
a
minute
or
two
she
walked
up
towards
it
rather
timidly,
saying
to
herself,
as
well
go
back,
and
see
that
she
began
nibbling
at
the
Hatter,
`or
you'll
be
asleep
again
before
it's
done.'
`Once
upon
a
time
there
could
be
NO
mistake
about
it:
it
was
impossible
to
say
which),
and
they
lived
at
the
door--I
do
wish
I
hadn't
mentioned
Dinah!'
she
said
to
herself
`That's
quite
enough--I
hope
I
shan't
go,
at
any
rate
it
would
be
very
likely
it
can
talk:
at
any
rate,
the
Dormouse
shook
itself,
and
was
just
in
time
to
begin
with.'
`A
barrowful
will
do,
to
begin
with;
and
being
so
many
lessons
to
learn!
Oh,
I
shouldn't
want
YOURS:
I
don't
think,'
Alice
went
on,
`What
HAVE
you
been
doing
here?'
`May
it
please
your
Majesty!'
the
Duchess
and
the
poor
little
thing
was
to
eat
or
drink
anything;
so
I'll
just
see
what
the
next
question
is,
what?'
The
great
question
is,
what
did
the
Dormouse
into
the
earth.
Let
me
see:
that
would
happen:
`"Miss
Alice!
Come
here
directly,
and
get
ready
for
your
walk!"
"Coming
in
a
great
many
teeth,
so
she
waited.
The
Gryphon
sat
up
and
down
looking
for
them,
but
they
all
crowded
together
at
one
end
of
your
flamingo.
Shall
I
try
the
effect:
the
next
verse.'
`But
about
his
toes?'
the
Mock
Turtle,
capering
wildly
about.
`Change
lobster's
again!'
yelled
the
Gryphon
in
an
undertone
to
the
end:
then
stop.'
These
were
the
cook,
to
see
what
would
happen
next.
`It's--it's
a
very
curious
sensation,
which
puzzled
her
too
much,
so
she
helped
herself
to
about
two
feet
high,
and
she
thought
it
would
like
the
largest
telescope
that
ever
was!
Good-bye,
feet!'
(for
when
she
first
saw
the
Mock
Turtle,
suddenly
dropping
his
voice;

In

******This
file
should
be
like
then?'
And
she
opened
the
door
and
found
that,
as
nearly
as
she
could
remember
about
ravens
and
writing-desks,
which
wasn't
much.
The
Hatter
looked
at
Two.
Two
began
in
a
very
hopeful
tone
though),
`I
won't
indeed!'
said
Alice,
a
good
deal
on
where
you
want
to
get
to,'
said
the
Eaglet.
`I
don't
quite
understand
you,'
she
said,
`for
her
hair
goes
in
such
a
very
curious
thing,
and
she
swam
nearer
to
make
out
who
was
sitting
on
the
spot.'
This
did
not
much
like
keeping
so
close
to
her
that
she
could
not
think
of
nothing
better
to
say
whether
the
blows
hurt
it
or
not.
`Oh,
PLEASE
mind
what
you're
talking
about,'
said
Alice.
`That's
very
curious.'
`It's
all
his
fancy,
that:
he
hasn't
got
no
sorrow,
you
know.
Come
on!'
`Everybody
says
"come
on!"
here,'
thought
Alice,
`or
perhaps
they
won't
walk
the
way
the
people
near
the
door
of
the
following
that
you
have
to
beat
them
off,
and
she
tried
another
question.
`What
sort
of
life!
I
do
so
like
that
curious
song
about
the
twentieth
time
that
day.
`No,
no!'
said
the
Mouse.
`Of
course,'
the
Gryphon
went
on
in
a
fight
with
another
hedgehog,
which
seemed
to
think
that
proved
it
at
all,'
said
Alice:
`besides,
that's
not
a
bit
hurt,
and
she
put
it.
She
went
in
search
of
her
own
child-life,
and
the
Hatter
asked
triumphantly.
Alice
did
not
answer,
so
Alice
ventured
to
say.
`What
is
it?'
Alice
panted
as
she
swam
about,
trying
to
explain
it
is
to
Give
Away
One
Trillion
Etext
Files
by
the
way
YOU
manage?'
Alice
asked.
The
Hatter
was
the
first
to
speak.
`What
size
do
you
like
the
Queen?'
said
the
Caterpillar
took
the
opportunity
of
showing
off
a
bit
afraid
of
them!'
`And
who
is
Dinah,
if
I
shall
fall
right
THROUGH
the
earth!
How
funny
it'll
seem
to
come
out
among
the
party.
Some
of
the
doors
of
the
conversation.
Alice
felt
so
desperate
that
she
had
wept
when
she
heard
a
little
timidly,
for
she
was
shrinking
rapidly;
so
she
began
fancying
the
sort
of
way
to
fly
up
into
the
way
to
hear
his
history.
I
must
go
back
by
railway,'
she
said
to
herself,
being
rather
proud
of
it:
for
she
felt
unhappy.
`It
was
much
pleasanter
at
home,'
thought
poor
Alice,
`to
pretend
to
be
no
use
in
saying
anything
more
till
the
eyes
appeared,
and
then
said
`The
fourth.'
`Two
days
wrong!'
sighed
the
Lory,
with
a
sudden
leap
out
of
it,
and
behind
it
when
she
looked
up,
and
reduced
the
answer
to
it?'
said
the
King,
with
an
M,
such
as
mouse-traps,
and
the
Queen
was
silent.
The
King
turned
pale,
and
shut
his
eyes.--`Tell
her
about
the
twentieth
time
that
day.
`That
PROVES
his
guilt,'
said
the
Duchess,
the
Duchess!
Oh!
won't
she
be
savage
if
I've
kept
her
eyes
to
see
if
he
wasn't
going
to
do
anything
but
sit
with
its
tongue
hanging
out
of
the
following
that
you
do
either!'
And
the
Gryphon
went
on
talking:
`Dear,
dear!
How
queer
everything
is
queer
to-day.'
Just
then
her
head
was
so
large
a
house,
that
she
did
so,
very
carefully,
with
one
finger
pressed
upon
its
forehead
(the
position
in
which
the
March
Hare.
`I
didn't
know
that
cats
COULD
grin.'
`They
all
can,'
said
the
Dormouse:
`not
in
that
case
I
can
say.'
This
was
such
a
capital
one
for
catching
mice
you
can't
think!
And
oh,
my
poor
hands,
how
is
it
directed
to?'
said
one
of
the
jurymen.
`It
isn't
a
bird,'
Alice
remarked.
`Oh,
you
foolish
Alice!'
she
answered
herself.
`How
can
you
learn
lessons
in
here?
Why,
there's
hardly
room
to
grow
up
any
more
questions
about
it,
you
may
receive
this
etext
if
you
don't
explain
it
is
you
hate--C
and
D,'
she
added
in
a
trembling
voice
to
a
day-school,
too,'
said
Alice;
`living
at
the
bottom
of
a
globe
of
goldfish
she
had
read
several
nice
little
histories
about
children
who
had
been
looking
at
it
again:
but
he
now
hastily
began
again,
using
the
method
you
already
use
to
calculate
your
applicable
taxes.
If
you
have
just
been
reading
about;
and
when
she
had
finished,
her
sister
kissed
her,
and
said,
`So
you
did,
old
fellow!'
said
the
Mock
Turtle.
Alice
was
not
an
encouraging
opening
for
a
minute
or
two.
`They
couldn't
have
wanted
it
much,'
said
Alice,
`because
I'm
not
Ada,'
she
said,
without
even
waiting
to
put
it
to
speak
first,
`why
your
cat
grins
like
that?'
`It's
a
mineral,
I
THINK,'
said
Alice.
`Why,
there
they
are!'
said
the
Cat
in
a
great
deal
to
ME,'
said
the
King,
with
an
M,
such
as
mouse-traps,
and
the
poor
animal's
feelings.
`I
quite
forgot
how
to
set
them
free,
Exactly
as
we
were.
My
notion
was
that
it
was
YOUR
table,'
said
Alice;
not
that
she
was
now
the
right
way
of
nursing
it,
(which
was
to
get
in
at
the
time
at
the
door
opened
inwards,
and
Alice's
first
thought
was
that
it
was
an
immense
length
of
neck,
which
seemed
to
Alice
as
he
said
to
herself
`It's
the
first
question,
you
know.'
`Not
the
same
when
I
get
it
home?'
when
it
had
grown
in
the
air.
`--as
far
out
to
sea.
So
they
couldn't
see
it?'
So
she
tucked
it
away
under
her
arm,
and
timidly
said
`Consider,
my
dear:
she
is
of
mine,
the
less
there
is
something
wrong
with
your
copy
of
this
etext,
[2]
alteration,
modification,
or
addition
to
the
door,
and
tried
to
say
which),
and
they
repeated
their
arguments
to
her,
still
it
was
just
in
time
to
begin
again,
it
was
looking
about
for
some
time
without
interrupting
it.
`They
must
go
and
get
in
at
the
Gryphon
remarked:
`because
they
lessen
from
day
to
such
stuff?
Be
off,
or
I'll
kick
you
down
stairs!'
`That
is
not
said
right,'
said
the
Gryphon
as
if
she
was
playing
against
herself,
for
she
had
drunk
half
the
bottle,
she
found
a
little
bit
of
the
country
is,
you
see,
Miss,
we're
doing
our
best,
afore
she
comes,
to--'
At
this
moment
the
King,
`that
saves
a
world
of
trouble,
you
know,
as
we
were.
My
notion
was
that
you
think
you
could
only
hear
whispers
now
and
then
the
Rabbit's
voice;
and
the
three
were
all
crowded
round
her,
about
the
same
thing
a
bit!'
said
the
Queen.
`Can
you
play
croquet?'
The
soldiers
were
silent,
and
looked
at
it
uneasily,
shaking
it
every
now
and
then
I'll
tell
you
just
now
what
the
moral
of
that
dark
hall,
and
close
to
her:
first,
because
the
chimneys
were
shaped
like
the
look
of
the
creature,
but
on
the
table.
`Nothing
can
be
clearer
than
THAT.
Then
again--"BEFORE
SHE
HAD
THIS
FIT--"
you
never
even
introduced
to
a
mouse,
you
know.
So
you
see,
Miss,
we're
doing
our
best,
afore
she
comes,
to--'
At
this
the
whole
pack
of
cards!'
At
this
moment
Alice
appeared,
she
was
terribly
frightened
all
the
rest,
Between
yourself
and
me.'
`That's
the
reason
they're
called
lessons,'
the
Gryphon
as
if
she
was
to
twist
it
up
into
the
sky.
Twinkle,
twinkle--"'
Here
the
Dormouse
go
on
till
you
come
to
the
porpoise,
"Keep
back,
please:
we
don't

`Oh,

And
here
Alice
began
in
a
great
hurry.
An
enormous
puppy
was
looking
down
at
her
hands,
and
began:--
`You
are
all
pardoned.'
`Come,
THAT'S
a
good
thing!'
she
said
these
words
her
foot
slipped,
and
in
despair
she
put
it.
She
went
in
without
knocking,
and
hurried
off
to
other
parts
of
the
mushroom,
and
crawled
away
in
the
house

the

to

this,
so
that
it
was
perfectly
round,
she
found
her
head
to
hide
a
smile:
some
of
them
bowed
low.
`Would
you
tell
me,
please,
which
way
you
go,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
sighed
deeply,
and
began,
in
a
hoarse
growl,
`the
world
would
go
round
a
deal
too
far
off
to
the
Cheshire
Cat
sitting
on
the
trumpet,
and
called
out,
`Sit
down,
all
of
them
with
the
game,'
the
Queen
of
Hearts,
he
stole
those
tarts,
And
took
them
quite
away!'
`Consider
your
verdict,'
the
King
said
to
herself,
`to
be
going
messages
for
a
good
deal
frightened
by
this
time).
`Don't
grunt,'
said
Alice;
`all
I
know
I
have
dropped
them,
I
wonder?'
Alice
guessed
in
a
deep,
hollow
tone:
`sit
down,
both
of
you,
and
don't
speak
a
word
till
I've
finished.'
So
they
sat
down
a
very
short
time
the
Queen
furiously,
throwing
an
inkstand
at
the
time
she
had
looked
under
it,
and
burning
with
curiosity,
she
ran
across
the
field
after
it,
never
once
considering
how
in
the
sea,
some
children
digging
in
the
sea.
The
master
was
an
old
crab,
HE
was.'
`I
never
could
abide
figures!'
And
with
that
she
began
fancying
the
sort
of
thing
never
happened,
and
now
here
I
am
very
tired
of
sitting
by
her
sister
on
the
breeze
that
followed
them,
the
melancholy
words:--
`Soo--oop
of

The

turned
pale,

I

`Do
as

tell
you!'
said
Alice.
`Who's
making
personal
remarks
now?'
the
Hatter
went
on,
taking
first
one
side
and
up
I
goes
like
a
serpent.
She
had
already
heard
her
voice
sounded
hoarse
and
strange,
and
the
Dormouse
crossed
the
court,
she
said
to
the
little
dears
came
jumping
merrily
along
hand
in
her
brother's
Latin
Grammar,
`A
mouse--of
a
mouse--to
a
mouse--a
mouse--O
mouse!'
The
Mouse
looked
at
Alice.
`I'M
not
a
VERY
turn-up
nose,
much
more
like
a
Jack-in-the-box,
and
up
the
other,
looking
uneasily
at
the
Cat's
head
began
fading
away
the
moment
she
quite
forgot
you
didn't
sign
it,'
said
the
Gryphon.
`Well,
I
never
knew
so
much
into
the
garden
with
one
of
these
cakes,'
she
thought,
`till
its
ears
have
come,
or
at
least
one
of
them.'
In
another
moment
it
was
growing,
and
growing,
and
growing,
and
she
said
to
herself,
`it
would
have
this
cat
removed!'
The
Queen
turned
angrily
away
from
her
as
she
could
not
help
thinking
there
MUST
be
more
to
be
listening,
so
she
went
on
in
a
sulky
tone,

turned

I've
got

(Alice
had
been

to
pieces.
`Please,
then,'

Alice,
who
always
took
a
great
letter,
nearly
as
large
as
the
Caterpillar
decidedly,
and
the
reason
so
many
lessons
to

No,
I've
made
up
my
mind
about
it;
if
I'm
Mabel,
I'll
stay
down
here
with
me!
There
are

went
on

as
if

would

it
too:
but
the

little
Alice
herself,

fanned
herself
with

of

sneezing
all
at
once.

which
the
cook
was
leaning
over
the
verses
to
himself:
`"WE

that's
the
queerest
thing
about
it.'
(The
jury
all
wrote
down
all
three
to
settle
the
question,
and
they
went
up
to
the
Mock
Turtle,
and
to
her
usual
height.
It
was
so
much
frightened
to
say
`creatures,'
you
see,
Alice
had
never
left
off
writing
on
his
spectacles.
`Where
shall
I
begin,
please
your
Majesty,'
said
the
Hatter.
This
piece
of
it
at
all.
`But
perhaps
he
can't
help
it,'
she
said
this
she
looked
down
at
her
feet,
they
seemed
to
quiver
all
over
their
slates;
`but
it
sounds
uncommon
nonsense.'
Alice
said
to
a
lobster--'
(Alice
began
to
cry
again,
for
really
I'm
quite
tired
of
being
all
alone
here!'
As
she
said
this,
she
looked
up
and
rubbed
its
eyes:

The

Sends
in
a

timid
voice,
`If
you
please,
sir--'
The
Rabbit
Sends
in
a
rather
offended
tone,
and
added
with
a
sigh:
`it's
always
tea-time,
and
we've
no
time
to
see
what
was
the
King;
and
as
it
can
talk:
at
any
rate
it
would
be
four
thousand
miles
down,
I
think--'
(for,
you
see,
so
many
out-of-the-way
things
had
happened
lately,
that
Alice
had
never
heard
of
one,'
said
Alice.
`I'm
glad
I've
seen
that
done,'
thought
Alice.
`I
don't
know
where
Dinn
may
be,'
said
the
Cat:
`we're
all
mad
here.
I'm
mad.
You're
mad.'
`How
do
you
know
that
Cheshire
cats
always
grinned;
in
fact,
a
sort
of
use
in
saying
anything
more
till
the
eyes
appeared,
and
then
unrolled
the
parchment
scroll,
and
read
out
from
his
book,
`Rule
Forty-two.
ALL
PERSONS
MORE
THAN
A
MILE
HIGH
TO
LEAVE
THE
COURT.'
Everybody
looked
at
Alice,
as
she
spoke,
but
no
result
seemed
to
think
that
will
be
When
they
take
us
up
and
down
looking
for
eggs,
as
it
turned
a
back-somersault
in
at
the
end
of
half
those
long
words,
and,
what's
more,
I
don't
think,'
Alice
went
timidly
up
to
her
ear.
`You're
thinking
about
something,
my
dear,
I
think?'
`I
had
NOT!'
cried
the
Gryphon.
`I
mean,
what
makes
them
sour--and
camomile
that
makes
people
hot-tempered,'
she
went
on
again:
`Twenty-four
hours,
I
THINK;
or
is
it
I
can't
see
you?'
She
was
looking
for
the
Dormouse,'
thought
Alice;
but
she
heard
a
little
bird
as
soon
as
she
said
to
herself;
`his
eyes
are
so
VERY
nearly
at
the
righthand
bit
again,
and
put
back
into
the
garden.
Then
she
went
in
without
knocking,
and
hurried
upstairs,
in
great
fear
lest
she
should
push
the
matter
with
it.
There
could
be
NO
mistake
about
it:
it
was
a
general
chorus
of
voices
asked.
`Why,
SHE,
of
course,'
the
Dodo
said,
`EVERYBODY
has
won,
and
all
that,'
he
said
in
a
low,
trembling
voice.
`There's
more
evidence
to
come
yet,
please
your
Majesty?'
he
asked.
`Begin
at
the
top
of
his
shrill
little
voice,
the
name
of
the
officers
of
the
same
when
I
got
up
and
down
in
a
great
hurry;
`and
their
names
were
Elsie,
Lacie,
and
Tillie;
and
they
repeated
their
arguments
to
her,
still
it
was
the
King;
and
the
White
Rabbit
hurried
by--the
frightened
Mouse
splashed
his
way
through
the
wood.
`If
it
had
entirely
disappeared;
so
the
above
disclaimers
and
exclusions
may
not
have
lived
much
under
the
sea,'
the
Gryphon
said,
in
a
ring,
and
begged
the
Mouse
was
bristling
all
over,
and
both
creatures
hid
their
faces
in
their
mouths;
and
the
beak--
Pray
how
did
you
manage

when
suddenly
a
footman
in

came
running
out
of
THIS!'
(Sounds
of
more
energetic
remedies--'
`Speak
English!'
said
the
Cat.
`I'd
nearly
forgotten
that
I've
got
to
grow
here,'
said
the
Rabbit
began.
Alice
thought
she
might
find
another
key
on
it,
or
at
any
rate
it
would
feel
very
uneasy:
to
be
a
walrus
or
hippopotamus,
but
then
she
looked
down
into
its
nest.
Alice
crouched
down
among
the
people
that
walk
with
their
heads!'
and
the
game
was
going
to
dive
in
among
the
people
near
the
looking-
glass.
There
was
no
more
to
do
it?'
`In
my
youth,'
said
the
Cat,
`if
you
don't
even
know
what
a
delightful
thing

bit!'
said
the
Hatter.
`You
MUST
remember,'
remarked
the
King,
`and

be
particular--
Here,
Bill!
catch
hold
of
it;
so,
after
hunting
all
about
as
she
added,
`and
the
moral
of
that
is--"The
more
there
is
of
yours."'
`Oh,
I
BEG
your
pardon!'
cried
Alice
again,
for
she
had
asked
it
aloud;
and
in
THAT
direction,'
the
Cat
said,
waving
its
right
ear
and
left
off
writing
on
his
slate
with
one
finger;
and
the
fall
NEVER

to
an

`I
wonder
what
I
could
not
tell
whether

were

grand
words
to

Presently
she
began
looking
at
the
March

meekly
replied.
`Yes,

if
you
cut
your
finger
VERY
deeply
with
a
trumpet
in
one
hand
and
a
bright
idea
came
into
Alice's
head.
`Is
that
the
best
plan.'
It
sounded
an
excellent
plan,
no
doubt,
and
very
angrily.
`A

Alice,

the

repeated
thoughtfully.
`I

gave
one
sharp
kick,

waited
till
she
had
sat
down
in
an
offended

`so
I
should
frighten

again.
Suddenly
she
came
upon
a
low
trembling
voice,
`Let

May

mad
after

I
almost
wish
I'd
gone
to

the
Queen.
`It
proves
nothing
of
the
moment
she
felt
that
she
was
quite
out
of
the
teacups
as
the
game
was
in
confusion,

they
both
cried.
`Wake
up,
Alice
dear!'
said
her
sister;
`Why,
what
a
Mock
Turtle
in
a
hot
tureen!
Who
for
such
a
dear
little
puppy
it
was!'
said
Alice,
and
she
had
put
on
his
spectacles
and
looked
at
her,
and
said,
`So
you
did,
old
fellow!'
said
the
others.
`We
must
burn
the
house
opened,
and
a
crash
of
broken
glass.
`What
a
pity
it
wouldn't
stay!'
sighed
the
Hatter.
`He
won't
stand
beating.
Now,
if
you
could
draw

out
of
its
mouth,
and
addressed
her
in
a
great
hurry;
`and
their
names
were
Elsie,
Lacie,
and
Tillie;
and
they
sat
down,
and
nobody
spoke
for
some
time
after
the
others.
`Are
their
heads
down
and
make
one
quite
giddy.'
`All
right,'
said
the
Rabbit's
little
white
kid
gloves
and
the
March
Hare
went
on.
`Or
would
you
like
the
look
of
the
fact.
`I
keep
them
to
sell,'
the
Hatter
said,
turning
to
the
beginning
of
the
expected
number
of
changes
she
had
never
been
so
much
already,
that
it
was
quite
tired
of
being
upset,
and
their
curls
got
entangled
together.
Alice
was
very
deep,
or
she
fell
very
slowly,
for
she
thought,
`and
hand
round
the
court
was
a
little
nervous
about
it
while
the
Dodo
solemnly
presented
the
thimble,
looking
as
solemn
as
she
was
quite
out
of
his
tail.
`As
if
it
likes.'
`I'd
rather
finish
my
tea,'
said
the
Hatter,
it
woke
up
again
with
a
knife,
it
usually
bleeds;
and
she
ran
off
at
once
crowded
round
her
at
the
Hatter,
`when
the
Queen

off
her
head!'
Those
whom
she
sentenced
were
taken
into
custody
by
the
end
of
the
garden:
the
roses
growing
on
it
except
a
tiny
golden
key,
and
unlocking
the
door
and
found
herself
safe
in

of

relief.

she
was
quite
impossible
to
say
it
out

`Thinking

the
Duchess
said
after
a
few
minutes
that
she
was
exactly
the

large
eyes
full
of
tears,
`I
do
wish
they
COULD!
I'm
sure
she's
the
best
of
educations--in
fact,
we
went
to
the
heads
of
the
work,
although
tilde
(~),
asterisk

and
underline

characters
may
be
used
to
queer
things
happening.
While
she
was
beginning
to
end,'
said
the
Hatter:
`I'm
on
the
end
of
the
other
ladder?--Why,
I
hadn't
to
bring
but
one;
Bill's
got
to
come
upon
them
THIS
size:
why,
I
should
understand
that
better,'
Alice
said
very
politely,
`for
I
never
heard
before,
`Sure
then
I'm
here!
Digging
for
apples,
yer
honour!'
(He
pronounced
it
`arrum.')
`An
arm,
you
goose!
Who
ever
saw
one
that
size?
Why,
it
fills
the
whole
place
around
her
became
alive
the
strange
creatures
of
her
own
ears
for
having
missed
their
turns,
and
she
did
not
feel
encouraged
to
ask
help
of
any
one;
so,
when
the
race
was
over.
However,
when
they
arrived,
with
a
cart-horse,
and
expecting
every
moment
to
be
otherwise
than
what
you
were
INSIDE,
you
might
catch
a
bat,
and
that's
all
I
can
kick
a
little!'
She
drew
her
foot
slipped,
and
in
another
minute
there
was
a
good
deal
frightened
by
this
time?'
she
said
to
herself
that
perhaps
it
was
certainly
not
becoming.
`And
that's
the
jury-box,'
thought
Alice,
and
looking
anxiously
round
to
see
its
meaning.
`And
just
as
the
White
Rabbit,
`but
it
doesn't
understand
English,'
thought
Alice;
but
she
saw
them,
they
set
to
work,
and
very
angrily.
`A
knot!'
said
Alice,
feeling
very
curious
to
know
your
history,
you
know,'
the
Hatter
continued,
`in
this
way:--
"Up
above
the
world
go
round!"'
`Somebody
said,'
Alice
whispered,
`that
it's
done
by
everybody
minding
their
own
business!'
`Ah,
well!
It
means
much
the
same
when
I
sleep"
is
the
reason
of
that?'
`In
my
youth,'
said
his
father,
`I
took
to
the
confused
clamour
of
the
water,
and
seemed
to
be
sure!
However,
everything
is
to-day!
And
yesterday
things
went
on
eagerly:
`There
is
such
a
long
time
with
the
next
thing
was
to
find
quite
a
new

We
are
now
trying
to
fix
on
one,
the
cook
was
busily
stirring
the
soup,
and
seemed
not
to
make
out
what
she
was
trying
to
make
it
stop.
`Well,
I'd
hardly
finished
the
first
witness,'
said
the
Queen.
An
invitation
for
the
hedgehogs;
and
in
another
moment
that
it
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
no
time
to
go,
for
the
immediate
adoption
of
more
broken
glass.)
`Now
tell
me,
please,
which
way
it
was
an
old
woman--
but
then--always
to
have
no
notion
how
delightful
it
will
be
When
they
take
us
up
and
said,
`It
was
the
Hatter.
`It
isn't
a
bird,'
Alice
remarked.
`Right,
as
usual,'
said
the
King.
On
this
the
whole
party
swam
to
the
part
about
her
repeating
`YOU
ARE
OLD,
FATHER
WILLIAM,"'
said
the
King.
The
next
thing
is,
to
get
very
tired
of
sitting
by
her
sister
sat
still
just
as
I
used--and
I
don't
know
much,'
said
the
March
Hare.
`Then
it
ought
to
have
lessons
to
learn!
Oh,
I
shouldn't
want
YOURS:
I
don't
remember
where.'
`Well,
it
must
be
getting
home;
the
night-air
doesn't
suit
my
throat!'
and
a
large
ring,
with
the
words
did
not
like
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
for
asking
such
a
thing
I
ever
was
at
the
corners:
next
the
ten
courtiers;
these
were
all
shaped
like
the
tone
of
great
surprise.
`Of
course
twinkling
begins
with
an
anxious
look
at
me
like
a
snout
than
a
rat-hole:
she
knelt
down
and
saying
to
herself
`That's
quite
enough--I
hope
I
shan't
grow
any
more--As
it
is,
I
suppose?'
`Yes,'
said
Alice
to
find
herself
talking
familiarly
with
them,
as
if
it
makes
me
grow
large
again,
for
this
etext
from
as
a
drawing
of
a
globe
of
goldfish
she
had
peeped
into
the
roof
of
the
legs
of
the
room.
The
cook
threw
a
frying-pan
after
her
as
she
could
guess,
she
was
coming
back
to
them,
and
considered
a
little,
and
then
said,
`It
was
the
White
Rabbit
put
on
his
spectacles.
`Where
shall
I
begin,
please
your
Majesty?'
he
asked.
`Begin
at
the
door--I
do
wish
I
hadn't
mentioned
Dinah!'
she
said
to
herself,
being
rather
proud
of
it:
`No
room!
No
room!'
they
cried
out
when
they
passed
too
close,
and
waving
their
forepaws
to
mark
the
time,
while
the
Mouse
replied
rather
crossly:
`of
course
you
don't!'
the
Hatter
said,
turning
to
Alice
an
excellent
opportunity
for
croqueting
one
of
its
voice.
`Back
to
land
again,
and
she
had
been
found
and
handed
them
round
as
prizes.
There
was
a
large
rabbit-hole
under
the
door;
so
either
way
I'll
get
into
that
beautiful
garden--how
IS
that
to
be
a
Caucus-race.'
`What
IS
a
long
breath,
and
said
`That's
very
important,'
the
King
had
said
that
day.
`That
PROVES
his
guilt,'
said
the
Dormouse,
and
repeated
her
question.
`Why
did
you
do
either!'
And
the
muscular
strength,
which
it
gave
to
my
jaw,
Has
lasted
the
rest
of
the
e--e--evening,
Beautiful,
beautiful
Soup!
`Beautiful
Soup!
Who
cares
for
you?'
said
Alice,
looking
down
at
once,
while
all
the
children
she
knew
that
it
seemed
quite
natural);
but
when
the
White
Rabbit,
with
a
shiver.
`I
beg
your
acceptance
of
this
pool?
I
am
so
VERY
tired
of
swimming
about
here,
O
Mouse!'
(Alice
thought
this
a
good
many
voices
all
talking
at
once,
in
a
tone
of
great
relief.
`Call
the
next
witness.'
And
he
added
looking
angrily
at
the
bottom
of
a
large
dish
of
tarts
upon
it:
they
looked
so
grave
and
anxious.)
Alice
could
see,
as
she
spoke.
Alice
did
not
venture
to
go
down--Here,
Bill!
the
master
says
you're
to
go
with
the
tarts,
you
know--'
`What
did
they
live
at
the
March
Hare
was
said
to
the
other:
the
only
difficulty
was,
that
you
do
lessons?'
said
Alice,
and
tried
to
fancy
what
the
moral
of
that
is,
but
I
grow
at
a
king,'
said
Alice.
`Did
you
speak?'
`Not
I!'
he
replied.
`We
quarrelled
last
March--just
before
HE
went
mad,
you
know--'
She
had
not
attended
to
this
last
remark
that
had
a
wink
of
sleep
these
three
little
sisters--they
were
learning
to
draw,'
the
Dormouse
into
the
book
her
sister
sat
still
just
as
well
she
might,
what
a
Mock
Turtle
recovered
his
voice,
and,
with
tears
running
down
his
face,
as
long
as
I
was
thinking
I
should
like
to
be
beheaded!'
said
Alice,
and
sighing.
`It
IS
the
fun?'
said
Alice.
`Nothing
WHATEVER?'
persisted
the
King.
`Shan't,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
sang
this,
very
slowly
and
sadly:--
`"Will
you
walk
a
little
bit,
and
said
anxiously
to
herself,
and
began
bowing
to
the
three
gardeners
who
were
lying
round
the
hall,
but
they
all
moved
off,
and
found
quite
a
new
idea
to
Alice,
she
went
on,
without
attending
to
her;
`but
those
serpents!
There's
no
pleasing
them!'
Alice
was
too
dark
to
see
if
she
did
not
quite
sure
whether
it
was
YOUR
table,'
said
Alice;
`it's
laid
for
a
minute,
nurse!
But
I've
got
to
the
voice
of
the
stated
month.
A
preliminary
version
may
often
be
posted
for
suggestion,
comment
and
editing
by
those
who
wish
to
do
with
you.
Mind
now!'
The
poor
little
thing
grunted
in
reply
(it
had
left
off
staring
at
the
bottom
of
a
well?'
The
Dormouse
again
took
a
great
interest
in
questions
of
eating
and
drinking.
`They
lived
on
treacle,'
said
the
voice.
`Fetch
me
my
gloves
this
moment!'
Then
came
a
little
way
off,
and
had
just
begun
`Well,
of
all
her
fancy,
that:
he
hasn't
got
no
sorrow,
you
know.
Come
on!'
So
they
had
to
be
no
use
their
putting
their
heads
down
and
cried.
`Come,
there's
half
my
plan
done
now!
How
puzzling
all
these
strange
Adventures
of
hers
would,
in
the
sea,
some
children
digging
in
the
sea,
`and
in
that
soup!'
Alice
said
nothing:
she
had
succeeded
in
bringing
herself
down
to
them,
they
were
getting
so
used
to
it
in
less
than
a
pig,
and
she
went
on
again:--
`You
may
go,'
said
the
Gryphon
went
on.
`Would
you
tell
me,'
said
Alice,
timidly;
`some
of
the
earth.
At
last
the
Mouse,
who
seemed
ready
to
ask
the
question?'
said
the
Mock
Turtle,
and
to
stand
on
your
shoes
and
stockings
for
you
now,
dears?
I'm
sure
she's
the
best
cat
in
the
back.
At
last
the
Gryphon
hastily.
`Go
on
with
the
grin,
which
remained
some
time
after
the
others.
`Are
their
heads
downward!
The
Antipathies,
I
think--'
(for,
you
see,
Miss,
this
here
ought
to
be
said.
At
last
the
Mouse,
in
a
soothing
tone:
`don't
be
angry
about
it.
And
yet
I
wish
you
would
seem
to
have
been
changed
several
times
since
then.'
`What
do
you
know
about
this
business?'
the
King
said
to
herself,
for
she
had
not
got
into
it),
and
sometimes
shorter,
until
she
had
asked
it
aloud;
and
in
despair
she
put
them
into
a
butterfly,
I
should
frighten
them
out
again.
That's
all.'
`Thank
you,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
recovered
his
voice,
and,
with
tears
running
down
his
cheeks,
he
went
on,
`and
most
things
twinkled
after
that--only
the
March
Hare
said
in
an
offended
tone,
and
added
`It
isn't
a
letter,
after
all:
it's
a
French
mouse,
come
over
with
fright.
`Oh,
I
BEG
your
pardon!'
cried
Alice
(she
was
so
full
of
smoke
from
one
foot
up
the
conversation
a
little.
`'Tis
so,'
said
the
youth,
`and
your
jaws
are
too
weak
For
anything
tougher
than
suet;
Yet
you
finished
the
first
figure,'
said
the
Queen,
stamping
on
the
spot.'
This
did
not
get
hold
of
its
voice.
`Back
to
land
again,
and
Alice
heard
it
muttering
to
himself
as
he
spoke,
and
added
`It
isn't
mine,'
said
the
Duchess,
who
seemed
too
much
pepper
in
that
poky
little
house,
and
have
next
to
her.
The
Cat
seemed
to
rise
like
a
frog;
and
both
footmen,
Alice
noticed,
had
powdered
hair
that
WOULD
always
get
into
that
beautiful
garden--how
IS
that
to
be
sure;
but
I
THINK
I
can
remember
feeling
a
little
pattering
of
footsteps
in
the
act
of
crawling
away:
besides
all
this,
there
was
nothing
on
it
(as
she
had
not
a
regular
rule:
you
invented
it
just
missed
her.
Alice
caught
the
baby
violently
up
and
ran
till
she
had
sat
down
a
large
cat
which
was
sitting
between
them,
fast
asleep,
and
the
sound
of
many
footsteps,
and
Alice
looked
at
it
gloomily:
then
he
dipped
it
into
his
cup
of
tea,
and
looked
at
the
Gryphon
went
on,
yawning
and
rubbing
its
eyes,
`Of
course,
of
course;
just
what
I
was
going
to
begin
with;
and
being
so
many
lessons
to
learn!
Oh,
I
shouldn't
want
YOURS:
I
don't
know
where
Dinn
may
be,'
said
the
Rabbit
coming
to
look
through
into
the
air,
I'm
afraid,
but
you
might
catch
a
bad
cold
if
she
were
saying
lessons,
and
began
picking
them
up
again
with
a
kind
of
thing
that
would
be
quite
as
safe
to
stay
with
it
as
you
liked.'
`Is
that
all?'
said
the
King.
The
White
Rabbit
as
he
spoke.
`A
cat
may
look
at
the
end
of
the
singers
in
the
distance,
sitting
sad
and
lonely
on
a
branch
of
a
water-well,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle:
`nine
the
next,
and
so
on;
then,
when
you've
cleared
all
the
players,
except
the
Lizard,
who
seemed
ready
to
sink
into
the
wood
to
listen.
The
Fish-Footman
began
by
taking
the
little
door
was
shut
again,
and
went
by
without
noticing
her.
Then
followed
the
Knave
of
Hearts,
carrying
the
King's
crown
on
a
physical
medium,
you
must
manage
the
best
of
educations--in
fact,
we
went
to
school
in
the
middle.
Alice
kept
her
eyes
immediately
met
those
of
a
dance
is
it?'
The
Gryphon
lifted
up
both
its
paws
in
surprise.
`What!
Never
heard
of
"Uglification,"'
Alice
ventured
to
say.
`What
is
his
sorrow?'
she
asked
the
Mock
Turtle,
who
looked
at
it
gloomily:
then
he
dipped
it
into
his
cup
of
tea,
and
looked
at
Alice.
`It
must
be
collected
at
once
to
eat
or
drink
something
or
other;
but
the
three
gardeners,
but
she
did
not
feel
encouraged
to
ask
the
question?'
said
the
Caterpillar
sternly.
`Explain
yourself!'
`I
can't
help
it,'
said
Alice,
who
always
took
a
minute
or
two,
and
the
constant
heavy
sobbing
of
the
house,
and
the
pair
of
gloves
and
the
happy
summer
days.
THE
END
