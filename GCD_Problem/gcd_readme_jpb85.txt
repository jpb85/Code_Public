G1 Programming Assignment 1
The programs are two ways of computing the greater common Divisor through the euclidean alogrithm.
The first way is through iteration. The second way is through recursion. They use the formula provided by the cpp files.
QTSpim in windows 7 was used to run the program.
The program will ask for two numbers. The numbers must be positive. Type in the first number then press enter then type in the second number and press enter again.
I tested both programs with the inputs 12 and 90. The resulting gcd was 6 as it should be.
I was rather preplexed that the recursive program was longer than the iterative one. 
An explaination of the difference between j and jal would have helped me. Though I might of just missed it.
